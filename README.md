**Title**

Protein-Suite

**Description**

Bioinformatic programs that create  alignment matrixes for sets of protein sequences and analyze protein sequences to determine the proportion of conserved sites via Grantham Distances. The _alignment_matrix.py_ program generates the alignment matrix while the _site_proportion.py_ program generates pie charts showing the proportion of conserved. 

Python was the programming language of choice as it is perfect for bioinformatics projects.
I hope to implement a traceback function into the _alignment.py_ program to properly align the protein sequences.

As for the libraries:
- xlsxwriter: Used for outputting the alignment graph to an xlsx sheet
- itertools: Used the combinations function to create all possible pairwise combinations of amino acids
